			<h2>We are proud of our alma mater</h2>
			<p>1. VISION :
				“ determined to promote high quality secondary education to all students of St. Paul’s Senior High School in consonance with 
				the Ministry’s goals and aspirations”
               </P>
               <p>
			2. MISSION  :
			“ to provide relevant education to all students of St. Paul’s Senior High School to enable them develop their mental, moral, 
			cultural and physical potentials so as to excel in their chosen carriers to live meaning =full lives and to contribute positively 
			towards societal development” </P>
              <p>
			3. BRIEF HISTORY OF INSTITUTION
			St. Paul’s was the first and only catholic second cycle Institution established in the southern sector of the then Keta-Ho Diocese 
			in 1953 by Bishop Konings. The school is now under the Episcopal jurisdiction of Keta-Akatsi Diocese headed by His Lordship Anthony 
			Kwame Adanuty</P>
			<p>
			The founding fathers were Fr. J. Caffrey the founder and the first Headmaster of St. Paul’s Secondary School. He was later joined 
			by Rev. Fr. Steemers as co-administrator of the school.
			Fr. J. Caffrey who was also said to be a good builder, worked so hard to the admiration of the Bishop that the first motto of the 
			school which was “In Deo Omia Possum” (with God all things are possible) was changed to “ Vinci in Bono Malum “ ( Conquer Evil by 
			Doing Good ) to suit also the history of St Paul’s and the Patron saint of the school and perhaps as an admonition to Fr. Caffrey 
			and admiration for his attitude.</p>
